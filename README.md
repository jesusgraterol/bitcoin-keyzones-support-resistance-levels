# Bitcoin KeyZones (Support & Resistance Levels)

Even though financial markets don't follow any easy-to-identify patterns, as the number of factors that influence the price are significantly large and not always present in historic data that can be accessed by individuals, support and resistance levels (KeyZones) are very helpful when it comes down to trading with trend-following and/orÂ dollar cost averaging strategies.

KeyZones are price levels that act as barriers to price movement. Support levels are prices where buyers are likely to step in and buy, preventing the price from falling further. Resistance levels are prices where sellers are likely to step in and sell, preventing the price from rising further.

It is important to note that support and resistance levels are not always reliable. The price of an asset can break through a support or resistance level if there is a significant change in supply or demand.

This notebook will identify these levels (in a programmatic manner) by looking for areas where the price has repeatedly bounced off of a particular price level.
